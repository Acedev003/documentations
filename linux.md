## Introduction
Wrapping the user’s commands this **shell** program.

The original Unix shell program was just called sh, but it has been extended and superceded over the years, so on a modern Linux system you’re most likely to be using a shell called **bash**. 

Users could even write simple code (called **shell scripts**) which could be used to automate long series of shell commands in order to make complex tasks easier.
